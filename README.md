### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Create an isolated environment to manage dependencies.

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv chatbot-env
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv chatbot-env
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Get Your Groq API Key
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/) and create an account.
2. Once registered and logged in, generate an API key from your account dashboard.
3. Copy the generated API key.

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and paste your API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

```

Replace `your_groq_api_key` with the Groq API key in .env file
